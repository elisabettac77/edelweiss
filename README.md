# Edelweiss

Hello. I'm a super-lightweight theme called `Edelweiss`. I have been built to demonstrate how small a ClassicPress site can be.

**Note 1** I am a fork of SustyWP, you can use me as a starting point to build your own theme because I deliver _just enough_ to get you started.
**Note 2** I can also be used as is if you want to have a barebones, no frill blogging experience.
